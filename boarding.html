        <h3>DOG BOARDING</h3>
        <p>
          Dogs boarding with us will enjoy a staycation, burning off any excess
          energy during a full day of play with our daycare dogs. Dogs are
          separated into supervised playrooms depending on size, play style and
          temperament, ensuring the comfort and safety of all our guests.
          They'll enjoy 8-10 hours of open play that features brain games
          designed to improve manners and behavior. There will also be plenty of
          time for naps and breaks, should they require them. If your dog is
          having lunch, he/she will be fed at the start of naptime and will have
          plenty of time to digest their food before they are allowed to play
          again. This private time is also when we administer any medications,
          if applicable.

        <h3>FOR BOARDING</h3>
        <p>
          Our boarding facilities are fully equipped to handle dogs of all
          shapes and sizes. We encourage you to bring your pup to our location
          for daycare prior to an overnight or extended stay. We recommend at
          least one day of daycare prior to your dog's overnight stay - three
          days of daycare is ideal - to allow your pup to get used to the
          facility and have a better overall experience. Your dog will become
          comfortable with our staff, and learn that you will be coming back to
          bring them home. It will also give our staff an opportunity to learn
          your pup's personality and play preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ask that you arrive with your dog before 3 p.m. on the day they are
          to begin boarding. Dogs may be dropped off as early as we open.

        <h3>WHAT TO BRINGG</h3>
        <p>
          We care about your dog's safety and comfort. We encourage you to bring
          your pup's own food to maintain their regular diet and avoid any
          digestion issues. You may consider bringing a little extra food for
          boarding as they burn a lot more calories in play than they typically
          do at home! If you forget your food for meals - no worries! We have
          in-house food for your convenience.
        </p>
        <p>
          During their boarding stay, your dog will be fed at approximately 7
          a.m. and 7 p.m., with a treat or lunch at nap time if you request.
          Food will be served and prepared exactly as requested by each pet
          parent. We'll accommodate any special dietary needs your pup may have,
          and won't charge extra for feeding or administering medication.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are encouraged to bring any bedding that will make your dog feel
          “at home” and we will provide it only to them. (Please remember we
          cannot guarantee bedding will be returned in the same condition.)
        </p>
        <p>
          As your dog will play in an open area with other dogs, we do not
          accept toys from home. Your dog may feel possessive of their own toys
          and many are not suitable for the playroom as they are too easily torn
          or ripped.
